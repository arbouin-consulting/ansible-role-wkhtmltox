# Role Wkhtmltox

Installs wkhtmltopdf as .deb for Ubuntu.

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  vars:
    wkhtmltox_version: 0.12.5-1

  roles:
     - role: arbouin-consulting.wkthmltox
```
